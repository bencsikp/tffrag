You’ll have a better chance to get insightful mentoring from Boehringer Ingelheim people, should you select any of the CRM challenges. However, it is not a mandatory requirement, and no negative consequences in case you chose to select a challenge of a different nature.
For any of the challenges, define stakeholders (patients, caregivers, healthcare professionals, payors), as their perspective, incentives might differ significantly – so as your approach should.

Title: Living with heart failure (#1)
Description: Heart failure significantly impacts a person's ability to live a full life. Symptoms like fatigue and shortness of breath can make daily activities difficult. The management of heart failure places a significant burden on healthcare systems due to frequent hospitalizations, medications, and long-term care needs. Many patients with heart failure have other health conditions like diabetes, which complicate treatment and prognosis. Helping patients manage their condition effectively requires long-term lifestyle changes and good adherence to medications, which can be difficult for some individuals.

Considerations

How could you address unequal distribution of care between urban and rural areas, information, and communication gaps?
How does reimbursement impact screening, treatment, monitoring of heart failure?
What role could digital apps play in tracking & improving patient outcomes, quality of life?

Title: Obesity – globesity (#2)
Description: We're facing a strange double problem: on one hand, people are going hungry, while on the other, there's a growing worldwide issue of overweight and obesity, sometimes called "globesity." Overweight is a condition of excessive fat deposits. Obesity is a chronic complex disease defined by excessive fat deposits that can impair health. It's a complex issue with social and emotional factors too, and it affects people of all ages and income levels. Both rich and poor countries are struggling with it. Weight reduction has substantial impact in patients with or without diabetes. Psychological aspects of anti-obesity medications are not explored widely. Tackling the growth in obesity is critical to achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 3.4: to reduce by one third premature mortality from NCDs by 2030.

Considerations

Treatment or prevention of obesity?
What actions could be taken at the national level to address obesity as a disease, and what would be the potential benefits for the healthcare and insurance systems?
Given that obesity also affects low- and middle-income countries, what strategies could be implemented to ensure equitable access to effective treatment options, including anti-obesity medications and bariatric surgery?
Cultural aspects of lifestyle (importance of physical activity, fitness level, diet)
Does Instagram affect health behaviour? Could social be media used to improve health?
Fatphobia, microaggression

Title: CKD – you can have it, do you have it? (#3)
Description: Kidneys do not receive the attention they deserve. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in the public is associated with dialysis and transplantation. However, this is not the case. Prevalence varies, but 10% of the population will develop CKD, partially because of the aging population. Diabetes and cardiovascular diseases play a significant role, but not only those are responsible. CKD is diagnosed and risk-stratified with estimated glomerular filtration rate utilizing serum creatinine and measuring urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (eGFR, uACR), but this is underutilized, and healthcare professionals find it challenging to interpret the uACR. Cost and access to screening/treatment are significant barriers.

Considerations

What could be done to better care for the kidneys?
Which strategies should be used to detect renal function, perform risk stratification, and respond accordingly?
How could we improve the difficulties of analysing eGFR and uACR in the context of comorbidities to select patients who need nephrologist care?
How could we promote screening, considering the age group’s specific needs?
What specific considerations must be taken to reach the underserved communities?

Mental Health
Title: Stigma – I’m just different (#4)
Description: Stigma, lack of access, lack of support – common situations in case of mental health issues. According to a study conducted by The Harris Poll: „A total of 87% of American adults agreed that having a mental health disorder is nothing to be ashamed of, and 86% said they believe that people with mental health disorders can get better, according to the poll.” Is it the case in Europe too?
3.7 % of all deaths in the EU in 2020 resulted from mental and behavioural disorders. In 2021 there were 3.1 million in-patients with mental and behavioural disorders who were discharged from hospitals in 24 of the EU Member States for which data are available.

Consideration:

How communities or companies could embrace more the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion (DEI) concept, particularly regarding neurodiversity?
What additional support/tools could be provided to people with schizophrenia, depression, ADHD?

Title: Care for the caregivers (#5)
Description: One in three physicians is experiencing burnout at any given time. This may not only interfere with their own wellbeing but also with the quality of delivered care. Family and other informal caregivers provide most of the long-term care to older adults as well as others with chronic illnesses and disabilities. Women, caring for a spouse or children was more stressful and detrimental to mental health than caring for parents or others.

Considerations

How can we address mental health issues of caregivers?
How can we utilize AI to support caregivers?
How can we reduce the workload of physicians in the frame of today's healthcare system?
What risks AI bots could pose for the mental health?

Title: Mental health and pregnancy (#6)
Description: pregnancy is a special period of life for a mother, but also for the whole family. During a medical consultation it is not possible for the doctor to talk about a full set of information due to time restrictions, leading the pregnant women to search for additional information online. Although the internet has facilitated wide access to information, there is now concern about unreliable sources. 
The many doubts of pregnant women make them go to the emergency room more often, which generates additional concerns. 

Considerations

How to increase the health literacy of pregnant women other than during consultation?
How to address mental health changes during pregnancy?
How to get reliable information about nutrition, exercise, vaccination, and other important topics for pregnant women in a timely and effective way? Should there be a system to manage access to reliable and quality information?
How can digital innovation be used to provide pregnant women and their families with reliable, personalized, and accessible health information outside of clinical consultations?
How can healthcare systems better detect and support women experiencing postpartum depression, considering the stigma and lack of awareness that often prevent early diagnosis and treatment?
What innovative approaches could improve mental health care during the postnatal period for both mothers and families?

Health literacy, underserved communities
Title: Explain me like I'm 5, 45, 95 (#7)
Description: describing and explaining complex health issues, procedure is challenging for the healthcare professionals, while on the receiving end, it is also difficult to process/comprehend medical jargon, scientific terms, especially under duress. Finding the right wording might help („heart function is reduced” vs. „reduced ejection fraction”). Low health literacy is reflected in the disappointing public health outcomes in many parts of the world. There is a need to improve the public’s ability to obtain, read, understand, and use healthcare information to make appropriate health decisions and follow instructions for treatment.

Stakeholders

Healthcare providers: family physicians, clinics, and hospitals responsible for delivering health services.
General public: individuals concerned about healthy ageing and seeking improved access to quality health care.
Citizen groups: associations and NGOs working on health literacy initiatives, fostering collaboration across professional and geographic boundaries to advance health literacy research and practice.
Technology experts: developers, programmers, and designers capable of creating digital solutions to enhance healthcare.
Policy makers: government officials and policymakers who can shape regulations and policies to support improved healthcare delivery.
Considerations

Design an innovative solution to improve the general public’s health literacy. The focus should be on technical/digital tools and/or communication campaigns.
Medical treatment is not the only factor that accounts for good human health. General health checks should be done once a year for every adult. Using vitamins prophylactically, getting vaccinated on time, daily practical recommendations on how to take care of health etc. are essential.
Furthermore, public health outcomes may differ within the same country or region. Therefore, lessening this health divide is also important.

Challenges defined by YOU
It is perfectly fine, allowed and encouraged to come up with a healthcare challenge on your own. It would best work if you can substantiate your claims and needs based on scientific evidence. You will need to complete the observation and need assessments steps. More insights, needs and scientific evidence you have – more chance to convince your team to select the challenge defined and relevant for you.

Some guiding questions:

What is the challenge?
How big is the issue? Money-wise or number of people impacted.
Who is impacted by the issue?
Who are the stakeholders?
How is it managed currently?
Why do current approaches fail?
