One inspiring success story is Flowtion, a start-up that originated from the programme and is now making strides in fitness and rehabilitation technology.

From idea to innovation: Flowtion’s journey
Flowtion is dedicated to enhancing physical performance and recovery through AI-driven movement recognition and real-time feedback. What started as an idea at EIT Health’s Top Female Founders Summer School has now developed into a venture backed by the AWS First Incubator Programme.

“Participating in the Top Female Founders Summer School was a game-changer for launching Flowtion,” says Inès, CEO of Flowtion. “The programme provided a comprehensive toolkit to turn ideas into reality, with hands-on knowledge, expert mentorship, and a strong community of female entrepreneurs. It gave me both the confidence and the practical skills to move forward.”

For Valentina, Flowtion’s CTO, the programme was not just a learning experience but a catalyst for action. “Receiving the acceptance letter was already meaningful – it was recognition and inclusion,” she shares. “During the programme, we built our first prototype and refined our strategy with the help of mentors. The experience helped us pivot to the fitness sector, which led to our first funding.”

Panka, Flowtion’s CFO, also highlights the programme’s influence on the team’s success. “The programme brought us together as a diverse, women-led venture. Even though I initially participated as a mentor, I gained valuable insights into the healthcare market, which helped us shape our business strategy.”

A network that supports growth
Beyond business strategies and product development, the Top Female Founders Summer School fostered a strong network of mentors, peers, and industry leaders. Flowtion’s success exemplifies how collaboration between talented female entrepreneurs and expert guidance can drive meaningful change in healthcare innovation.

Looking ahead, Flowtion is focused on validating its solution and launching a go-to-market strategy this year, Valentina unveils. “We are eager to grow Flowtion by refining our business models and securing funding opportunities that align with our strengths,” says Panka. “The support and connections we’ve gained have set us on a promising path, and we are determined to make a significant impact in the fitness and health tech industries.”

As Flowtion continues to grow, its founders remain committed to paying it forward. “I’m eager to inspire the next generation of female entrepreneurs,” says Inès. “With the support of EIT Health and this incredible community, the future looks bright – and we’re just getting started!”
